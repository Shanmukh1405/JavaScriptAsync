### 1. **Commit the Changes**
- In the Source Control panel, write a commit message like "Update README file" and commit the changes.
- Or in the terminal:
  ```bash
  git commit -m "Update README file"
  ```

### 2. **Push the Changes to GitHub**
- Push the commit to your GitHub repository:
  ```bash
  git push origin master
  ```
- Replace `master` with your branch name if you're working on a different branch.

### 3. **Verify on GitHub**
- Visit your GitHub repository in your web browser and check the `README.md` file to ensure the updates are reflected.

That's it! You've successfully updated your `README.md` file and pushed the changes to GitHub.
